In the dense forests of the Pacific Northwest, the early morning fog rolls in thick and heavy, wrapping itself around the towering pines and cedars. The scent of damp earth fills the air, mingling with the fresh pine aroma. Every step on the soft, moss-covered ground seems to echo in the silence of the wilderness. Birds slowly begin to chirp as the sun rises, casting long shadows that dance among the trees. This place, seemingly untouched by time, feels like a refuge from the chaos of the modern world, where nature reigns supreme and every living thing exists in a delicate balance.
